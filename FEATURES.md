## Integration and Architecture

### React Query

- Automatic query caching with configurable stale time
- Background refetching and cache invalidation
- Optimistic updates for responsive UI
- Loading, error, success, and refetching state management

### Tauri Bridge API

- Type-safe API calls to the Node.js bridge
- Session management for concurrent queries
- Real-time event listeners for streaming query results
- Custom events: `bridge:query.result`, `bridge:query.progress`, `bridge:query.done`, `bridge:query.error`
- Session-based event filtering

### Event-Driven Architecture

All database and Git operations use a JSON-RPC protocol over stdin/stdout. The bridge process runs independently of the UI, providing process isolation and crash resilience.

## Performance

### Optimization Techniques

- Hover-based data prefetching for predictive loading
- Component-level code splitting and lazy loading
- `React.memo`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo` for render optimization

### Caching Strategy

| Layer | Purpose |
| ----- | ------- |
| React Query | API response caching |
| localStorage | User preferences and theme settings |
| Session storage | Temporary data and session state |
| Query history | Persistent query log |
